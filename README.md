## 🔍 What is Visly?

**Visly** is a lightweight Chrome extension designed to make job hunting smarter.  
If you've ever sent out dozens of resumes and wondered if anyone even opened them—this is for you.

With Visly, you can generate a unique, trackable link to your resume tied to the name of the person you're sending it to.  
When they open it, you'll get a clean notification with their **name, date, and time**.  
That’s it. No signups, no logins, no complicated setup.
